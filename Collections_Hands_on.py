school["Bob"]["Science"] = 95
# 5. Print the final school dictionary
print("Final School Dictionary: ",school)

#Exercise-6: List Comprehension
# 1. Given list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# 2. Create a new list with squared numbers using list comprehension
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
# 3. Print the new list
print("New list of Squared numbers are: ",squared_numbers)

#Exercise-7: Set Comprehension
# 1. Create a set comprehension to generate squared numbers

#Exercise-8: Dictionary comprehension
# 1. Create a dictionary comprehension for cubes
cubes_dict = {x: x**3 for x in range(1, 6)}
# 2. Print the resulting dictionary
print("Result of cubes dictionary: ",cubes_dict)

#Exercise-9: Combining collections
# 1. Create two lists
keys = ["name", "age", "city"]
values = ["Alice", 25, "Paris"]
# 2. Use zip() to combine them into a dictionary
combined_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
# 3. Print the resulting dictionary
print("Result dictionary: ",combined_dict)

#Exercise-10: Count word occurrences(using a dictionary)
#1. Input sentence
sentence="the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the fox"
# 2. Split sentence into words and count occurrences
word_count = {}
for word in sentence.split():
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1
# 3. Print the resulting dictionary with word counts
print("word count result dictionary: ",word_count)

#Exercise-11: Unique Elements in Two Sets
# 1. Create the two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
# 2. Find and print the unique elements in both sets combined
unique_elements = set1.union(set2)
print("Unique elements:",unique_elements)
# 3. Find and print the common elements between the two sets
common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
print("Common elements:",common_elements)
